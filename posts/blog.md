<p>Hello! It’s me!<br>
Over the last few months I’ve become more and more interested on writing various posts. Normally I’d head over to Medium and write stuff their, but I’m honestly kind of annoyed by the paywall they have set up right now. (I’ve honestly never been a fan of paying for stuff monthly, it’s such a pain.)</p>
<h2 id="what-are-my-posts-going-to-be-about">What are my posts going to be about?</h2>
<p>I’m not quite sure what posts I’m going to be writing here. Some will probably be related to my videos, while others won’t be related in the slightest.<br>
I’m also going to be working on setting up an email notification system; it’ll probably work better than YouTube notifications.<br>
Anyways, expect more posts from me soon!</p>
